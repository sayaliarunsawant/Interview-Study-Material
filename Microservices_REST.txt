Microservices 

1) What is microservices?
-> - Small and focused services
   - Autonomus (packaging microservices on their own machines)

2) Characteris/Advantages of Microservices :
	- Microservices can written in different programming languages and delploy on different servers.
	- Robustness : If one of the component down then it will not impact on whole system.
	- Scalability : We can deploy those microservices on services depending upon the number of users using it.
	- Easy to deploy : we can deploy particular microservice in ehich we have fixed the bug or can add new feature.
	- Reusability and replacibility
	
3) SOA(Service Oriented Architecture) and Microservices : 
	- SOA is design approach which collabarate multiple services to provide some end to end buiseness functinality.Does not focused on split application
	  in multiple small services but microservices does this.
	- Microservices is better version of SOA.

4) REST(Representational State Transfer) :
	- REST is the bunch of architectural guidelines.
	- HTTP helps to easily implements REST
	- CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE

5) HTTP Methods :
	- POST   : Create a resource. 201 response code (/employees - collection resource  /employees/emp_id - item resource)
	- GET    : read a resource.   200 response code 
	- PUT    : update a resource. 200 response code (partial update is not possible)
	- PATCH  : It updtae the partial item resource. 200 response code. 
	- DELETE : delete a resource. 200 response code
	
6) Spring Data REST : 
	- It simplified the operations from DAO layers (JPA Entity ,extends CrudRepository<Entity,Type of Id>)
